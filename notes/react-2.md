# Rendering List and conditional content

## conditional rendering
- inorder to lets say conditionally render something we can use the teriniart operatpr inside a {} in a jsx expression (if else cannot be done as its a single line statement)
- also the condition on the terniary could be a state of the component
- you can extract out the div logic part (jsx part) outside to a variable in java script and then render use the per son variable  to render (using {var name}) make sure this is in the render function as re-rendering calls the render method
